# Endovascular Neural Recording Research

Welcome to the public repository for our research on endovascular neural recording techniques. This repository provides a comprehensive overview of our work, including a detailed wiki explaining key terms and concepts related to our research.

## Overview

Our research focuses on developing a minimally invasive method to record neural activity using a device called a stentrode. The stentrode is a stent with electrodes attached, which can be placed within blood vessels to achieve chronic neural recordings. This approach aims to minimize the trauma and inflammation associated with traditional intracranial electrode arrays.

## Repository Structure

### Public Repository

This public repository contains:
- **Wiki**: A comprehensive glossary and explanation of key terms and concepts related to our research. It serves as an educational resource for those interested in neural recording technologies.
- **README**: This document, providing an overview of the repository and its contents.

### Private Repository (Submodule)

In addition to this public repository, we maintain a private repository that contains all research files, including detailed experimental data, code, and proprietary information. The private repository is included here as a submodule.

To access the private repository, you will need the appropriate permissions. If you are a collaborator or have been granted access, you can initialize and update the submodule using the following commands:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
